# Deploy this project to production ðŸš€

This project is deployed to production using:

- Vercel for the web app
- [Hasura cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/) for the Hasura GraphQL Server
- [Railway.app](https://railway.app/new/template/7UlZ-K?referralCode=WYM_Zc) for the Nestjs server + Postgres & Redis

Additionally, we use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking and monitoring.

## Sentry

Sign up for a [free Sentry account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and create a new organization.

### Setup for Nestjs server

1. Create a new project with the type `Express`.

2. Copy the `DSN` value from the `Client Keys (DSN)` section and set it as an environment variable called `SENTRY_DSN` in your `.env` file.

### Setup for Nextjs web app

1. Create a new project with the type `Next.js`.

2. Copy the `DSN` value from the `Client Keys (DSN)` section and set it as an environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` in your `.env` file.

## Deploy Nestjs server + Postgres & Redis to Railway.app

Click the button below to deploy the Nestjs server app to Railway.app. This will create a new Railway.app project and deploy the app to it. You will need to provide the following environment variables:

### Add Hasura integration

https://vercel.com/integrations/hasura

Select your hasura project and your vercel project

- add hasura-vercel-integration image

This will add those env variables to your vercel project with the right values:

```.env
HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET
```

### Env variables

You are going to need to set env variables in vercel for the web app. You can do this by going to the vercel dashboard and clicking on the project. Then click on settings and then environment variables. You will need to set the following variables:

```.env
NX_CACHE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/.nx

PBKDF2_KEY_SIZE=
PBKDF2_ITERATIONS=
TOKEN_LIFE_TIME=

# for google sign in
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

# for github sign in

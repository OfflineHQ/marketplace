This model is crucial in tracing the movement of an NFT, especially when validating that an event pass has reached its intended recipient. Such a system facilitates debugging and reduces the need for excessive querying of our indexer. Entries in this table are populated through two primary avenues: either via an activity webhook responding to real-time NFT transfers or through a regular cron job as a failsafe, ensuring data integrity even if the webhook fails to capture certain events.';

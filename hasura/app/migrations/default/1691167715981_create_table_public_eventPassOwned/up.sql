Given the nature of NFTs, they can be transferred to any existing or future account. Our blockchain indexer and RPC service handle the responsibility of updating this model to reflect the current address that possesses this NFT/Pass.  The primary purpose of this model is to indicate whether the Pass has been revealed or not while maintaining an updated list of NFT ownership for each user on our platform. This allows us to track if the user owning the NFT at a particular time has accessed the QR Code associated with it. If the Pass is not marked as \'revealed\', it provides assurance to potential buyers that the QR Code has remained confidential, thereby guaranteeing their access to the event.  However, it\'s important to note that, while this system generally functions effectively, additional checks should be put in place for critical features like the reveal process to prevent any potential misuse or fraudulent activities.';
